# Iris Classification Project

## Project Title
This notebook demonstrates a machine learning project for classifying iris flower species.

## Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

## Load Dataset
```python
# Load the iris dataset from a CSV file
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv'
dataset = pd.read_csv(url, header=None)

# Adding column names to the dataset
dataset.columns = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'class']
```

## Explore Dataset
```python
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(dataset.head())

# Get summary statistics
print(dataset.describe())

# Check for any missing values
print(dataset.isnull().sum())
```

## Train-Test Split
```python
# Split the dataset into features and target variable
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values  # Features
Y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values    # Target class

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Data Visualization
```python
# Visualize data distribution
sns.pairplot(dataset, hue='class')
plt.show()
```

## Train KNN Model
```python
# Create the KNN model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

## Make Prediction
```python
# Make predictions on the test set
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Evaluate Accuracy
```python
# Evaluate the model accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```
